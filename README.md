## Sample: Using Remote Entities

This integration supports `remote` entities generated from Nature Remo's defined `signals`. These entities allow you to send IR commands directly from Home Assistant.

### Example: Service Call

You can call a signal like this using `remote.send_command`:

```yaml
service: remote.send_command
target:
  entity_id: remote.living_room_remote  # Your remote entity ID
data:
  command: "Power On"  # The name of the signal as defined in Remo
```
